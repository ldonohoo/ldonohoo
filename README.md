##  Welcome üåª
I'm a Full Stack developer that really enjoys coding, learning new things, and working with other humans to teach, learn, and connect. I'm a really positive person and  bring enthusiasm and positivity to the teams I work on üòÅ

I have a BS in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and 8+ years of experience in older tech dev.

Took a break for parenting, but just completed a fast-paced 6 month full-time, in-person certification for Full-Stack Web Development that included a solo project and a pro-bono project for a great entrepenuer. Totally loving it...

   To pursue an interest of mine, I arranged to work for two summers as a wildlife biologist on the El Dorado National Forest in California (next to Lake Tahoe), and did contracting in the off-season. Decided against full-time biology, but it was a great experience with no regrets üòä
